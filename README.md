# Enforcer

This is my second attempt at a programmatic restriction system for Garry's Mod. It implements a detour library with blocking, modifying, pre and post functions, alongside several implementations for detouring popular addons.

Very much so a work in progress. See the wiki for the current API implementation (may change as this addon develops!)
